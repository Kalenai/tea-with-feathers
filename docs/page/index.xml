      <description>My name is Jed Davis. I&amp;rsquo;m a self-taught developer with a particular interest in infrastructure and overarching systems. I have my B.S. in Biology and a minor in Biochemistry, which is many ways was what first exposed me to the idea of large, complex, systems that elegantly connect together.
I also enjoy cooking, music (both listening and playing), painting, and occasionally gaming. I&amp;rsquo;m currently living in the frozen north of South Dakota, but will soon be moving back to my home state of Texas.</description>
