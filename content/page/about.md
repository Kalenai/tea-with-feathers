My name is Jed Davis.  I'm a self-taught developer with a particular interest in infrastructure and overarching systems.
I have my B.S. in Biology and a minor in Biochemistry, which is many ways was what first exposed me to the idea of large,
complex, systems that elegantly connect together.

I also enjoy cooking, music (both listening and playing), painting, and occasionally gaming.  I'm currently living in the
frozen north of South Dakota, but will soon be moving back to my home state of Texas.

If you want to get in touch with me, email is the best way.  I do also check GitHub and LinkedIn fairly frequently.
